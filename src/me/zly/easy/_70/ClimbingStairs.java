 * You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
 *
 * Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
 *
 * Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *        Input: 2
 *        Output: 2
 *        Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
 *        1. 1 step + 1 step
 *        2. 2 steps
 *
 * Example 2:
 *        Input: 3
 *        Output: 3
 *        Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
 *        1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
 *        2. 1 step + 2 steps
 *        3. 2 steps + 1 step
